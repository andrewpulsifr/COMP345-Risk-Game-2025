 * @brief Comprehensive test function for Player class functionality
 * @details Tests all requirements:
 *          - Player owns a Hand of cards (pointer member)
 *          - toDefend() method returns owned territories
 *          - toAttack() method returns attackable adjacent enemy territories  
 *          - issueOrder() method adds orders to player's OrdersList
 * 
 * Creates a simple game scenario with two players (Alice and Bob) owning
 * territories with adjacency relationships, then demonstrates all required
 * Player class methods and functionality.
